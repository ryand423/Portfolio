This is a supplement document to assist the use of my Penetration Testers Checklist


Things to keep up to date on:
  - google OWASP Top Ten 2021 (do this research once a month and/or annually).
  - Create a google alert for "zero day attacks" and "ransomware" so that google crawls the web and emails you the latest cyber security events/attacks.
