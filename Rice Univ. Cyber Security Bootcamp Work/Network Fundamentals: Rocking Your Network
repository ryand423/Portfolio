Networking Fundamentals: Rocking your Network

Make a copy of this document to work in, and then for each phase, add the solution below the prompt. Save and submit this completed file as your Challenge deliverable.


Phase 1: “I’d like to Teach the World to ping”

Command(s) used to run fping against the IP ranges:

fping -g 15.199.95.80 15.199.95.106


Summarize the results of the fping command(s):

All the IPs within the range are unreachable


List of IPs responding to echo requests:

161.35.96.20




Explain which OSI layer(s) your findings involve:

Ping requests (ICMP) - Layer 3 - Network


Mitigation recommendations (if needed):

Run the command sudo nmap 161.35.96.20 -sS to see which ports are open



Phase 2: “Some SYN for Nothin`”

Which ports are open on the RockStar Corp server?

22
53


Which OSI layer do SYN scans run on?

OSI Layer:

Layer 4 Transport Layer


Explain how you determined which layer:

Layer 4 processes transportation protocols. A port is a transport layer address.


Mitigation suggestions (if needed):

Disable ping responses on the application server



Phase 3: “I Feel a DNS Change Comin’ On”

Summarize your findings about why access to rollingstone.com is not working as expected from the RockStar Corp Hollywood office:

It appears that it may be routed to some other IP address





Command used to query Domain Name System records:

nslookup


Domain name findings:




Explain what OSI layer DNS runs on:

Layer 7 - Application layer 


Mitigation suggestions (if needed):

Modify the DNS hosts file to redirect to the correct IP address



Phase 4: “ShARP Dressed Man”



Explain the OSI layers for HTTP and ARP.

Layer used for HTTP:

Layer 7 - Application layer


Layer used for ARP:

Layer 2 - Data Link Layer
